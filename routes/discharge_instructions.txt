Objective 1
Assist with the handoff once a patient is discharged, all the follow ups that happen between the case manager and the vendor management.
Current Process:
Patience with pneumonia goes home
Agent calls - Did you take your medication, did you do these exercises, etc.
(Currently there are discharge instructions which can be leveraged but needs to be customized) 
Notes:
Tracker of the patient exists within Medsetgo. This data needs to feed into this platform
They will build the APIs and we will consume that data
We build the AI agent that reads the notes, and based on that the next steps of the calling etc happens and then we handover data back to them.
HIPPA Compliance + other regulatory issues

Objective 2
To illustrate how the case management module and the conversational AI voice agent can work together to streamline support for MedSetGoâ€™s platform users.

Input Channels:
Voice Calls (via AI Voice Agent)
AI Chatbot - Website/WhatsApp/iMessage Chat
Email Support
Support Portal (Direct Ticket Submission)

Assumptions:
Users primarily need support for using the MedSetGo platform.
The AI Voice Agent will handle basic, repetitive queries and initial triaging.
Complex issues may require human intervention. This can either be handed off the a live agent in real time OR
Salesforce integration allows for seamless tracking and escalation.

Step 1: User Interaction Initiation
Voice Call/WhatsApp/Email/Portal Entry
Users can initiate support through multiple channels.
Voice agent handles initial triaging of calls and queries.
The voice agent is integrated with the case management back end (Salesforce based) to fetch user details, previous support history and log active discussion
Chatbot Interaction
Chat Session Initialization:
User initiates a chat via the web or app interface.
Quick Responses:
Uses NLP to recognize common issues and offers solutions from the knowledge base.
Redirection to Self-Help:
Provides links to detailed guides, video tutorials, or help articles.
Issue Escalation:
If unresolved, chatbot creates a case in Salesforce and informs the user that a support agent will follow up.

Step 2: AI Voice Agent Interaction
Call Routing and Basic Support:
Gather user information (Contact details, purpose of call).
Stores or verifies identity
Responds to basic queries using pre-configured responses.
Intelligent Query Handling:
For complex issues or unresolved queries, the agent hands off to a human support representative.
Uses the case management solution (Salesforce based) to log the call, create a ticket, and tag it with the issue type.
Follow up by sharing a link or document which offers solutions from the knowledge base and provides links to detailed guides, video tutorials, or help articles.

Step 3: Case Management via Salesforce
Automatic Ticket Creation:
Ticket is created through any of the input channels
If AI Voice Agent, it creates a case with all call details.
Case Routing:
Based on the issue type (technical, administrative, billing), the case is routed to the appropriate support flow or hand off to human agent
Automated Status Updates:
Users receive updates via WhatsApp, iMessage, SMS, or email based on the chosen communication preference

Step 4: Human Agent Involvement (if required)
Case Assignment:
If the issue requires manual intervention, it is assigned to a human agent.
Agent Actions:
Review the case, contact the user if needed, and resolve the issue.
Update case status and resolution notes.
Escalation Protocol:
If unresolved within a predefined time, the case is escalated to higher-tier support.

Step 5: Resolution and Closure
Automatic Notification:
Once resolved, users are notified via their preferred channel.
Feedback Collection:
An automated prompt for feedback on the support experience is sent.
Data Logging:
Case details are stored in the case management system for future reference and analytics.

Step 6: Monitoring and Reporting
Dashboard View:
Real-time updates on open, in-progress, and resolved cases.
Performance Metrics:
Average handling time, first response rate, and resolution rate.
Insights:
Use data for optimizing AI responses and identifying common support issues.
