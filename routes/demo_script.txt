Action plan if saturation drops below 92%.

3. Infection Control:
Personal Hygiene:
Regular hand washing with soap and water.
Use of disposable tissues for coughing or sneezing.

Key Considerations:
Tone and Empathy:
The agent must use a calm, patient, and empathetic tone, especially when discussing health complications.
Data Accuracy:
Ensure that all patient-specific data is dynamically pulled from the API before initiating the call.
Escalation Protocol:
If a critical symptom is reported (e.g., difficulty breathing), the agent should immediately escalate to a human healthcare professional.
Data Handover:
All call logs and patient responses should be stored in the Salesforce CRM for future reference.

"My oxygen is fine today."
No issues with oxygen therapy.
"Can someone help me with my meds?"
Request for assistance – flag as non-compliance.
"I feel dizzy sometimes."
